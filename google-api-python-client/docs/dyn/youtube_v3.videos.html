<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(id, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a YouTube video.

Args:
  id: string, The id parameter specifies the YouTube video ID for the resource that is being deleted. In a video resource, the id property specifies the video's ID. (required)
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, USE_DESCRIPTION --- channels:list:onBehalfOfContentOwner
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getRating">getRating(id, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None)</code>
  <pre>Get user ratings for videos.

Args:
  id: string, The id parameter specifies a comma-separated list of the YouTube video ID(s) for the resource(s) that are being retrieved. In a video resource, the id property specifies the video's ID. (required)
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, USE_DESCRIPTION --- channels:list:onBehalfOfContentOwner

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A list of video ratings returned as the response to a youtube.videos.getRating call.
    "items": [ # A list of ratings that match the request criteria.
      { # Basic details about rating of a video.
        "rating": "A String", # Rating of a video.
        "videoId": "A String", # The ID that YouTube uses to uniquely identify the video.

  <pre>Uploads a video to YouTube and optionally sets the video's metadata.

Args:
  part: string, The part parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include.

The part names that you can include in the parameter value are snippet, contentDetails, player, statistics, status, and topicDetails. However, not all of those parts contain properties that can be set when setting or updating a video's metadata. For example, the statistics object encapsulates statistics that YouTube calculates for a video and does not contain values that you can set or modify. If the parameter value specifies a part that does not contain mutable values, that part will still be included in the API response. (required)

  media_body: string, The filename of the media request body, or an instance of a MediaUpload object.
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, USE_DESCRIPTION --- channels:list:onBehalfOfContentOwner
  stabilize: boolean, The stabilize parameter specifies whether the video should be stabilized by YouTube.
  onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel: string, This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter indicates that the request's authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value. This parameter must be used in conjunction with the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and the user must be authenticated using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. In addition, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.

This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.
  autoLevels: boolean, The autoLevels parameter specifies whether the video should be auto-leveled by YouTube.

  <pre>Returns a list of videos that match the API request parameters.

Args:
  part: string, The part parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more video resource properties that the API response will include. The part names that you can include in the parameter value are id, snippet, contentDetails, player, statistics, status, and topicDetails.

If the parameter identifies a property that contains child properties, the child properties will be included in the response.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="rate">rate(id, rating, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None)</code>
  <pre>Like, dislike, or remove rating from a video.

Args:
  id: string, The id parameter specifies the YouTube video ID. (required)
  rating: string, Specifies the rating to record. (required)
    Allowed values
      dislike - Records that the authenticated user disliked the video.
      like - Records that the authenticated user liked the video.
      none - Removes any vote (like or dislike) the authenticated user had for the video.

</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(part=None, body, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates a video's metadata.

Args:
  part: string, The part parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include.

The part names that you can include in the parameter value are snippet, contentDetails, player, statistics, status, and topicDetails.

Note that this method will override the existing values for all of the mutable properties that are contained in any parts that the parameter value specifies. For example, a video's privacy setting is contained in the status part. As such, if your request is updating a private video, and the request's part parameter value includes the status part, the video's privacy setting will be updated to whatever value the request body specifies. If the request body does not specify a value, the existing privacy setting will be removed and the video will revert to the default privacy setting.

In addition, not all of those parts contain properties that can be set when setting or updating a video's metadata. For example, the statistics object encapsulates statistics that YouTube calculates for a video and does not contain values that you can set or modify. If the parameter value specifies a part that does not contain mutable values, that part will still be included in the API response. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
