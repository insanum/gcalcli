#### Google Calendar Command Line Interface

gcalcli is a Python application that allows you to access your Google
Calendar(s) from a command line. It's easy to get your agenda, search for
events, add new events, delete events, edit events, see recently updated
events, and even import those annoying ICS/vCal invites from Microsoft
Exchange and/or other sources. Additionally, gcalcli can be used as a reminder
service and execute any application you want when an event is coming up.

gcalcli uses the [Google Calendar API version 3](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/).

HowTo
-----

#### Usage

`gcalcli` provides a series of subcommands with the following functionality:

    list                list available calendars
    edit                edit calendar events
    agenda              get an agenda for a time period
    updates             get updates since a datetime for a time period
    calw                get a week-based agenda in calendar format
    calm                get a month agenda in calendar format
    quick               quick-add an event to a calendar
    add                 add a detailed event to the calendar
    import              import an ics/vcal file to a calendar
    remind              execute command if event occurs within <mins> time

See the manual (`man (1) gcalcli`), or run with `--help`/`-h` for detailed usage.

#### Login Information

OAuth2 is used for authenticating with your Google account. The resulting token
is placed in the `~/.gcalcli_oauth` file. When you first start gcalcli the
authentication process will proceed. Simply follow the instructions.

**You currently have to use your own Calendar API token.** Our Calendar API token is restricted to few users only and waits for Google's approval to be unlocked.

1. [Create a New Project](https://console.developers.google.com/projectcreate) within the Google developer console
   1. Activate the "Create" button.
2. [Enable the Google Calendar API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/calendar-json.googleapis.com/)
   1. Activate the "Enable" button.
3. [Create OAuth2 consent screen](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent/edit;newAppInternalUser=false) for an "UI /Desktop Application".
   1. Fill out required App information section
      1. Specify App name. Example: "gcalcli"
      2. Specify User support email. Example: your@gmail.com
   2. Fill out required Developer contact information
      1. Specify Email addresses. Example: your@gmail.com
   3. Activate the "Save and continue" button.
   4. Scopes: activate the "Save and continue" button.
   5. Test users
      1. Add your@gmail.com
      2. Activate the "Save and continue" button.
4. [Create OAuth Client ID](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient)
   1. Specify Application type: Desktop app.
   2. Activate the "Create" button.
5. Grab your newly created Client ID (in the form "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com") and Client Secret from the Credentials page.
6. Call `gcalcli` with your Client ID and Client Secret to login via the OAuth2 Authorization Screen.
   ` gcalcli --client-id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com --client-secret=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx list`.
   In most shells, putting a space before the command will keep it, and therefore your secrets, out of history. Check with `history | tail`.
7. This should automatically open the OAuth2 authorization screen in your default browser.

#### HTTP Proxy Support

gcalcli will automatically work with an HTTP Proxy simply by setting up some
environment variables used by the gdata Python module:

```
http_proxy
https_proxy
proxy-username or proxy_username
proxy-password or proxy_password
```

Note that these environment variables must be lowercase.

#### Flag File

`gcalcli` is able to read default configuration information from a flag file.
This file is located, by default, at '~/.gcalclirc'.  The flag file takes one
command line parameter per line.

In the current version, the flag file only supports the global options (options
against the `gcalcli` program itself).  The plan, longer term, is to support a
a configuration formation (probably toml or ini), which will allow for
configuration of subcommands (such as `add`, `agenda`, `calw`, etc.)

Example:

```
--nocache
--nocolor
--default-calendar=CALENDAR_NAME
--client-secret=API_KEY
```

Note that long options require an equal sign if specifying a parameter.  With
short options the equal sign is optional.

#### Configuration Folders

gcalcli is able to store all its necessary information in a specific folder (use
the --configFolder option.) Each folder will contain 2 files: oauth and cache.
An optional 3rd file, gcalclirc, can be present for specific flags that you only
want to apply when using this configuration folder.

#### Importing VCS/VCAL/ICS Files from Exchange (or other)

Importing events from files is easy with gcalcli. The 'import' command accepts
a filename on the command line or can read from standard input. Here is a script
that can be used as an attachment handler for Thunderbird or in a mailcap entry
with Mutt (or in Mutt you could just use the attachment viewer and pipe command):

```sh
#!/bin/bash

TERMINAL=evilvte
CONFIG=~/.gcalclirc

$TERMINAL -e bash -c "echo 'Importing invite...' ; \
                      gcalcli --detail-url=short \
                              --calendar='Eric Davis' \
                              import -v \"$1\" ; \
                      read -p 'press enter to exit: '"
```

Note that with Thunderbird you'll have to have the 'Show All Body Parts'
extension installed for seeing the calendar attachments when not using
'Lightning'. See this
[bug report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505024)
for more details.

#### Event Popup Reminders

The 'remind' command for gcalcli is used to execute any command as an event
notification. This can be a notify-send or an xmessage-like popup or whatever
else you can think of. gcalcli does not contain a daemon so you'll have to use
some other tool to ensure gcalcli is run in a timely manner for notifications.
Two options are using cron or a loop inside a shell script.

Cron:
```sh
% crontab -l
*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/gcalcli remind
```

Shell script like your .xinitrc so notifications only occur when you're logged
in via X:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

[[ -x /usr/bin/dunst ]] && /usr/bin/dunst -config ~/.dunstrc &

if [ -x /usr/bin/gcalcli ]; then
  while true; do
    /usr/bin/gcalcli --calendar="davis" remind
    sleep 300
  done &
fi

exec herbstluftwm # :-)
```

By default gcalcli executes the notify-send command for notifications. Most
common Linux desktop enviroments already contain a DBUS notification daemon
that supports libnotify so it should automagically just work. If you're like
me and use nothing that is common I highly recommend the
[dunst](https://github.com/knopwob/dunst) dmenu'ish notification daemon.

Note that each time you run this you will get a reminder if you're still inside
the event duration.  Also note that due to time slip between machines, gcalcli
will give you a ~5 minute margin of error.  Plan your cron jobs accordingly.

#### Agenda On Your Root Desktop

Put your agenda on your desktop using
[Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky). The '--conky' option causes
gcalcli to output Conky color sequences. Note that you need to use the Conky
'execpi' command for the gcalcli output to be parsed for color sequences. Add
the following to your .conkyrc:

```
${execpi 300 gcalcli --conky agenda}
```

To also get a graphical calendar that shows the next three weeks add:

```
${execpi 300 gcalcli --conky calw 3}
```

You may need to increase the `text_buffer_size` in your conkyrc file.  Users
have reported that the default of 256 bytes is too small for busy calendars.

Additionaly you need to set `--lineart=unicode` to output unicode-characters
for box drawing. To avoid misaligned borders use a monospace font like 'DejaVu
Sans Mono'. On Python2 it might be necessary to set the environment variable
`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8` if you are using characters beyond ascii. For
example:
```
${font DejaVu Sans Mono:size=9}${execpi 300 export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 && gcalcli --conky --lineart=unicode calw 3}
```

#### Agenda Integration With tmux

Put your next event in the left of your 'tmux' status line.  Add the following
to your tmux.conf file:

```
set-option -g status-interval 60
set-option -g status-left "#[fg=blue,bright]#(gcalcli agenda | head -2 | tail -1)#[default]"
```

#### Agenda Integration With screen

Put your next event in your 'screen' hardstatus line.  First add a cron job
that will dump you agenda to a text file:

```
% crontab -e
```

Then add the following line:

```
*/5 * * * * gcalcli --nocolor --nostarted agenda "`date`" > /tmp/gcalcli_agenda.txt
```

Next create a simple shell script that will extract the first agenda line.
Let's call this script 'screen_agenda':

```
#!/bin/bash
head -2 /tmp/gcalcli_agenda.txt | tail -1
```

Next configure screen's hardstatus line to gather data from a backtick command.
Of course your hardstatus line is most likely very different than this (Mine
is!):

```
backtick 1 60 60 screen_agenda
hardstatus "[ %1` ]"
```
