gcalcli
=======

#### Google Calendar Command Line Interface

gcalcli is a Python application that allows you to access your Google
Calendar(s) from a command line. It's easy to get your agenda, search for
events, quickly add new events, and even import those annoying vCal invites
from Microsoft Exchange. Additionally, gcalcli can be used as a reminder
service to execute any application you want.

Check your OS Distribution for packages.

Requirements
------------

 * [Python 2](http://www.python.org)
 * Google's [GData](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client) Python 2 module
 * [dateutil](http://www.labix.org/python-dateutil) Python module
 * [vobject](http://vobject.skyhouseconsulting.com) Python module
 * A love for the command line!

Features
--------

 * list your calendars
 * show an agenda using a specified start/end date and time
 * ascii text graphical calendar display with variable width
 * search for past and/or future calendar events
 * "quick add" new events to a specified calendar
 * "add" a new event to a specified calendar (interactively or automatically)
 * import events from ICS/VCAL files to a specified calendar
 * easy integration with your favorite mail client (attachment handler)
 * run as a cron job and execute a command for reminders
 * work against specific calendars (by calendar type or calendar name regex)

                             respect to the specified [start] time
                           - when used with the 'search' command, ignore events
                             that have already occurred and only show future

                           the 'quick' and 'add' commands; if not specified,
                           Google code's default behavior occurs: no reminder is
                           set (documented, incorrectly, otherwise: as using the
                           default for the calendar, but this does not actually
                           happen)

   --title <title>         event details used by the 'add' command
   --where <location>      - the duration is specified in minutes

                             from standard input
                           - if -v is given then each event in the file is
                             displayed and you're given the option to import
                             or skip it, by default everything is imported
                             quietly without any interaction

  remind <mins> <command>  execute command if event occurs within <mins>
                           minutes time ('%s' in <command> is replaced with

                                         -title "Ding, Ding, Ding!" %s'
```

#### Login Information

You can provide gcalcli with your Google Calendar login information via one of
the following:

 * on the command line using the --user and --pw options
 * the config file
 * or interactively when prompted

In any case make sure you protect the information. It is highly recommended
you turn on
[Google's 2-Step Verification](http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=28786)
and use different application specific passwords for each system you're using
gcalcli on.

#### HTTP Proxy Support

gcalcli will automatically work with an HTTP Proxy simply by setting up some
environment variables used by the gdata Python module:

```
http_proxy
https_proxy
proxy-username or proxy_username
proxy-password or proxy_password
```

Note that these environment variables must be lowercase.

#### Config File

gcalcli is able to read default configuration information from a config file.
This file is location, by default, at '~/.gcalclirc' and must be formatted as
follows:

```
[gcalcli]
<config-option>: <value>
<config-option>: <value>
...
```

The available config items are the same as those that can be specified on the
command line.  Note that any value specified on the command line overrides the
config file.

```
user: <username>
pw: <password>
cals: <type>
cal: <name>[#color], <name>[#color], ...
24hr: <true|false>
detail-all: <true|false>
detail-location: <true|false>
detail-length: <true|false>
detail-reminders: <true|false>
detail-descr: <true|false>
detail-descr-width: <width>
ignore-started: <true|false>
width: <width>
mon: <true|false>
nd: <true|false>
cal-owner-color: <color>
cal-editor-color: <color>
cal-contributor-color: <color>
cal-read-color: <color>
cal-freebusy-color: <color>
date-color: <color>
border-color: <color>
locale: <locale>
reminder: <mins>
```

Note that you can specify a shell command and the output will be the value for
the config variable. A shell command is determined if the first character is a
backtick (i.e. '`'). An example is pulling a password from gpg:

```
pw: `gpg --decrypt ~/mypw.gpg`
```

#### Importing VCS/VCAL/ICS Files from Exchange (or other)

Importing events from files is easy with gcalcli. The 'import' command accepts
a filename on the command line or can read from standard input. Here is a script
that can be used as an attachment handler for Thunderbird or in a mailcap entry
with Mutt (or in Mutt you could just use the attachment viewer and pipe command):

```
#!/bin/bash

TERMINAL=evilvte
CONFIG=~/.gcalclirc

$TERMINAL -e bash -c "echo 'Importing invite...' ; \
                      gcalcli --config=$CONFIG import -v \"$1\" ; \
                      read -p 'press enter to exit: '"
```

Note that with Thunderbird you'll have to have the 'Show All Body Parts'
extension installed for seeing the calendar attachments when not using
'Lightning'. See this
[bug report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505024)
for more details.

#### Event Popup Reminders

The 'remind' command for gcalcli is used to execute any command as an event
notification. This can be a notify-send or an xmessage-like popup or whatever
else you can think of. gcalcli does not contain a daemon so you'll have to use
some other tool to ensure gcalcli is run in a timely manner for notifications.
Two options are using cron or a loop inside a shell script.

Cron:
```
% crontab -l
*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/gcalcli remind
```

Shell script like your .xinitrc so notifications only occur when you're logged
in via X:
```
#!/bin/bash

[[ -x /usr/bin/dunst ]] && /usr/bin/dunst -config ~/.dunstrc &

if [ -x /usr/bin/gcalcli ]; then 
  while true; do
    /usr/bin/gcalcli --config=~/.gcalclirc --cal="davis" remind
    sleep 300
  done &
fi

exec herbstluftwm # :-)
```

By default gcalcli executes the notify-send command for notifications. Most
common Linux desktop enviroments already contain a DBUS notification daemon
that supports libnotify so it should automagically just work. If you're like
me and use nothing that is common I highly recommend the
[dunst](https://github.com/knopwob/dunst) dmenu'ish notification daemon.

#### Agenda On Your Root Desktop

Put your agenda on your desktop using Conky. The '--conky' option causes
gcalcli to output Conky color sequences. Note that you need to use the Conky
'execpi' command for the gcalcli output to be parsed for color sequences. Add
the following to your .conkyrc:

```
${execpi 300 gcalcli --conky agenda}
```

To also get a graphical calendar that shows the next three weeks add:

```
${execpi 300 gcalcli --conky --cals=owner calw 3}
```

#### Agenda Integration With tmux

Put your next event in the left of your 'tmux' status line.  Add the following
to your tmux.conf file:

```
set-option -g status-interval 60
set-option -g status-left "#[fg=blue,bright]#(gcalcli agenda | head -2 | tail -1)#[default]"
```

#### Agenda Integration With screen

Put your next event in your 'screen' hardstatus line.  First add a cron job
that will dump you agenda to a text file:

```
% crontab -e
```

Then add the following line:

```
*/5 * * * * gcalcli --nc --ignore-started agenda "`date`" > /tmp/gcalcli_agenda.txt
```

Next create a simple shell script that will extract the first agenda line.
Let's call this script 'screen_agenda':

```
#!/bin/bash
head -2 /tmp/gcalcli_agenda.txt | tail -1
```

Next configure screen's hardstatus line to gather data from a backtick command.
Of course your hardstatus line is most likely very different than this (Mine
is!):

```
backtick 1 60 60 screen_agenda
hardstatus "[ %1` ]"
```
